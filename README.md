Based in Colchester, I spend most of my free time with computers, find how they tick and especially finding how to break them. I love experimenting with limits, bypassing resctrictions and overall pushing software to it's limits. 

I am **currently** employed at **Rollerite** ***LLC***, where we focus on devlivering *high-quality* robust Minecraft modifications, written in Java/Kotlin, for server-owners and players alike. I work in a team of passionate individuals, where my role is relationships with clients, and developing said mods, through this role i have learned a significant amount about the inner workings of software and how to write it.

This is started to love ***breaking*** software, and writing ***secure*** software, to prevent my own software from being broken.
